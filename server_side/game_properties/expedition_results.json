    [["Our expedition has detected a very weak energy signature and has decided to move closer to inspect it. What at first glance appeared to be a small asteroid formation to the sensors has turned out to be an abandoned fleet flying aimlessly through space. After closer inspection, they found out that the ships have no fuel left and most of them have already ran out of their battery emergency reserves. Despite their thorough attempts, they've been unable to figure out any clues as to what happened to the ships or where did the crew go. Nonetheless, most of the ships seem to be in an operable state. With enough fuel spare, it should be possible to refuel the ships and move some of the crew to man them so that they can be added to the expedition fleet"]],

As they close in, no signs of life can be found aboard the ships. Once the fleet moves close enough to properly inspect the state of the ships and search for anything worth of value left, one of the ships is suddenly engulfed in a massive explosion, creating a chain reaction.

The return time will also be longer than expected due to the damage suffered."]],

After arriving at the coordinates of the beacon's distress signal, an entire fleet drifting through space can be seen. After closing in, the scan doesn't find any source of life.
