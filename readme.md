In order to start a server, you need the following:

Wamp server with mariaDB
Node with npm
Installed all dependancies (use 'npm install' command)
To start the server, start the mariaDB server (wamp), then use script start ('npm start')
MariaDB will most likely require a certain databse with set tables, etc.
