In order to start a server, you need the following:

Wamp server with MySQL
Node with npm
Installed all dependancies (use 'npm install' command)
To start the server, start the MySQL server (wamp) (needs to be port 3306, user with username root without set password)
Import the database from the database folder
Use script start ('npm start') to run the BE

Use the following parameter order for passing command line arguments:
1 - string: the path to the save file from the root directory (e.g. server_side/save_files/save.txt)



*Was trying to use MariaDB, but found out it way too complicated for me to establish a connection with the db server alone. Searching for any type of general advice or already answered similar/same issue proved futile. The database does not seem to be very popular among/friendly to amateurs/beginner programmers


*Server currently lacks any means of security and enables all sorts of attacks. It's intended use is for localhost testing purposes only

For documentation refer to documentation/documentantion.html (outdated, no longer the case)


I've given up on this project due to lack of time to work on it further. Unfortunately, I've been planning a huge code optimization and refactor for a long time, but never got to do it. And with the lack of comments, reading the code is likely very difficult. If you've somehow managed to find this project and for some reason wish to understand or utilize any of the code, feel free to add me on discord and ask away - Newstory#1476
